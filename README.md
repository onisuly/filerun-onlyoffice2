# FileRun Plugin: ONLYOFFICE2
Plugin for [FileRun](https://www.filerun.com/) to integrate with ONLYOFFICE.

> This is a modified version of FileRun official ONLYOFFICE plugin, added ONLYOFFICE server JWT secret support.

# Installation
- Copy the "onlyoffice2" folder inside your FileRun installation folder's "customizables/plugins" folder.
- Open FileRun's control panel, add your ONLYOFFICE server url and JWT secret under "Files" -> "Plugins" -> "ONLYOFFICE 2"
- You might need to clear your browser's cache to see the new "Open with.." option. (Simply press Ctrl+F5 works for me)
